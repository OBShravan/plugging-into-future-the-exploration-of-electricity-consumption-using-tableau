🔌 Plugging into the Future: The Exploration of Electricity Consumption
📊 Project Overview
"Plugging into the Future" is a data visualization and analysis project focused on global and regional electricity consumption patterns. Using Tableau, this project explores the relationship between electricity usage and socio-economic indicators, highlighting trends over time, disparities across regions, and potential areas for sustainable energy development.

🎯 Objectives
Analyze historical electricity consumption data globally and regionally.

Visualize consumption trends across countries and continents.

Explore the correlation between electricity usage and factors such as GDP, population, and CO₂ emissions.

Identify key contributors to electricity demand and assess progress in renewable energy adoption.

📁 Data Sources
The dataset used in this project was obtained from:

Our World in Data - Electricity Consumption

World Bank Open Data

IEA - International Energy Agency

Key data features:

Country-level electricity consumption (TWh)

Per capita consumption

Energy mix (renewable vs non-renewable)

GDP per capita

CO₂ emissions

🛠 Tools & Technologies
Tableau Public: Data visualization and dashboard creation.

Microsoft Excel / Google Sheets: Data preprocessing and cleaning.

GitHub: Project hosting and version control.

📈 Key Visualizations in Tableau
🔹 Global Electricity Consumption Over Time
An interactive line graph showing the rise in electricity usage globally from 1960 to present.

🔹 Top Electricity Consumers (Map View)
A choropleth world map visualizing country-wise consumption patterns.

🔹 Electricity Consumption vs. GDP per Capita
Scatter plot showcasing the relationship between economic development and electricity usage.

🔹 Renewable Energy Share
Stacked bar charts comparing renewable vs non-renewable sources in major economies.

🔹 Per Capita Consumption Heatmap
A heatmap to compare consumption on a per-person basis across time.

📌 Insights & Findings
Global electricity consumption has increased fivefold since 1960, driven primarily by industrialization and technological advancement.

China, the U.S., and India are the top electricity consumers, collectively accounting for more than 50% of global demand.

Renewable energy adoption is increasing, but fossil fuels still dominate in many parts of the world.

There is a strong positive correlation between electricity consumption and GDP per capita, highlighting access disparity between developed and developing nations.

Africa and parts of Southeast Asia remain energy-poor, indicating the need for infrastructure investment and sustainable energy access.

🚀 Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive overview of electricity usage and its role in modern economies. By visualizing consumption patterns and their socioeconomic implications, this dashboard serves as a powerful tool for policymakers, researchers, and educators to understand and address global energy challenges.
